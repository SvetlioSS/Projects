Each player is a different colour and have 4 pawns. There is a dice which should be thrown after each turn. 
If 6 is thrown a player can put a pawn in the game in his specific starting square. If 6 is thrown the player 
gets an aditional turn. The pawns only move in one direction. When a pawn reaches it's player's starting square 
it can go inside the player's field. When a player take all of his pawns inside his field he wins the game. 
If a player step on top of an other player's pawns they are returned back to the starting area.

with links between them.
